# WolfControllers
game controllers developed using free and open source tools by TheBlackWolfPack

## about this branch
The use of this branch is the development of totally new controllers.

## adding a new controller and help in development
If you like to add a controller you've created or if you want to help in the development of another controller in this branch get in touch with the team to gain access. The team will probably want to get to know you before access will be granted though. So be patient and nice whenever a team member wants to get in touch. :-)
Every kind of controller should reside in their own sub directory. A template for the directory structure is included in this branch in the "new_controller" directory. Do NOT edit that directory! Crate a copy and rename it to whatever name suits your new controller.

## publishing
Once your new controller design and the corresponding wiki page template are finished move your controller directory into the "controllers" folder. Once there it will be reviewed by a team member and moved to the master branch if no issues are found. The same goes for software under the "software" directory. Be patient with the team as it may take a bit of time until someone is able to do review.
