# SW001 - Steering Wheel Base
The SW001 is the foundation of our concept of a realistic drivers environment for car, truck and bus simulators.

## features
It is where all the inputs of the drivers place will come together. Axis for steering, accelerator, break and clutch as well as all the buttons and rotary encoders. It is easily extendable with additional inputs by using a simple bus system.  
- 2 steering column levers with 5 buttons each (up, down, back, forth, sideway)
- 1 USB A 2.0 male connector (to Host System)
- 1 I2C bus connector for extension
- 1 6pin connector for pedals with support for 3 analog axis and 1 additional button

## versatile design
The SW001 can work together with a wide varity of steering wheels and additional inputs. The wheel is interchangeable so that you can always adapt to the one fitting best your needs. Pedals are connected directly to the A/D converter of the arduino microcontroller. Additional inputs like gear lever, hand brake and button panels can be connected by a simple and extendable bus system with up to 127 additional controllers.
